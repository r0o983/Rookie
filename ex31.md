# Python基础31(ex31.py)

## 基本概念

接收用户输入来进行判断该进入哪一个分支，动态进入代码块

Receive user input to determine which branch to enter, dynamically enter the code block

## 实际练习

```
#!/usr/bin/env python3
#-*- coding:utf-8 -*-

print ("You enter a dark room with two doors. Do you go through door #1 or door #2 ?")

door = input(">")
"""根据用户输入的数据来进行判断进入某一个分支"""
"""judging to enter a certain branch based on the data entered by the user"""

if door == '1' :
    print ("There's a giant bear here eating a cheese cake. What do you do ?")
    print ("1.Take the cake.")
    print ("2.Scream at the bear.")
    
    bear = input (">")
    if bear == '1' :
        print ("The bear eats your face off. Good job!")
    elif bear == '2' :
        print ("The bear eats your legs off. Good job!")
    else :
        print ("Well, doing %s is probably better. Bear runs away." % bear)

elif door == "2" :
    print ("You stare into the endless abyss at Cthulhu's retina.")
    print ("1. Blueberries.")
    print ("2. Yellow jacket clothespins.")
    print ("3. Understanding revolvers yelling melodies.")

    insanity = input(">")

    if insanity == '1' or insanity == '2' :
        print ("Your body survives powered by a mind of jello. Good job!")
    else :
        print ("The insanity rots your eyes into a pool of much. Good job!")

else :
    print ("You stumble around and fall on a knife and die. Good job!")
```

## 分析与总结

根据用户输入的数据来进行判断进入某一个分支，并执行相应的代码块，使用if elif来进行嵌套时，需要注意语法格式以及缩进

According to the data entered by the user it is determined to enter a certain branch and execute the corresponding code block When using if elif to nest you need to pay attention to the syntax format and indentation 

## 附加练习

### 练习1为游戏添加新的部分，改变玩家做决定的位置。尽自己的能力扩展这个游戏，不过别把游戏弄得太怪异了

#### 简述答案：

新增游戏用户生命值，如果用户被怪物伤害则生命值减一，生命值为0则游戏退出

Add game user health if the user is damaged by the monster the health is reduced by one and the health is 0 the game exits

### 脚本

```
#!/usr/bin/env python3
#-*- coding:utf-8 -*-
print ("You enter a dark room with two doors. Do you go through door #1 or door #2 ?")
life = 3 
# 设定初始生命值
# Set initial health
print (f"your life start is {life}")
#door = input(">")
"""根据用户输入的数据来进行判断进入某一个分支"""
"""judging to enter a certain branch based on the data entered by the user"""

while life >= 1 :
    door = input(">")
    if door == '1' :
        print ("There's a giant bear here eating a cheese cake. What do you do ?")
        print ("1.Take the cake.")
        print ("2.Scream at the bear.")
        
        bear = input (">")
        if bear == '1' :
            print ("The bear eats your face off. Good job!")
            life -= 1
            # 被怪物杀害生命值减1
            # Killed by monsters minus 1 health
            if life > 0 :
                print (f"you still have life:{life},if your life is 0 Game Over")
            else :
                print ("Game Over")
        elif bear == '2' :
            print ("The bear eats your legs off. Good job!")
            life -= 1
            if life > 0 :
                print (f"you still have life:{life},if your life is 0 Game Over")
            else:
                print ("Game Over")
        else :
            print ("Well, doing %s is probably better. Bear runs away." % bear)
            # 逃脱不减少生命值
            # Escape without reducing            
            print (f"you still have life:{life},if your life is 0 Game Over")

    elif door == "2" :
        print ("You stare into the endless abyss at Cthulhu's retina.")
        print ("1. Blueberries.")
        print ("2. Yellow jacket clothespins.")
        print ("3. Understanding revolvers yelling melodies.")

        insanity = input(">")

        if insanity == '1' or insanity == '2' :
            print ("Your body survives powered by a mind of jello. Good job!")
        else :
            print ("The insanity rots your eyes into a pool of much. Good job!")
            life -= 1
            if life > 0:
                print (f"you still have life:{life},if your life is 0 Game Over")
            else :
                print ("Game Over")
    else :
        print ("You stumble around and fall on a knife and die. Good job!")
        life -= 1
        print (f"you still have {life}, if your life is 0 Game Over")
```
